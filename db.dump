3	Speculoos Cookie Butter	Trader John's Speculoos Cookie Butter is, in its most simplistic terms, spreadable Speculoos cookies.

10	Pumpkin Butter	Doesn't actually contain butter, but it does have a distinctively rich, butter-like consistency.

20	Organic Bartlett Pears	These will generally be green and rather firm. Allow them to ripen at room temperature - their color will change to a yellow-ish hue.

14	Baking Chips	When baking is in season, chips become a necessity. We don’t mean potato chips. Or the English kind.

15	Chocolate Coconut Almonds	The premise is simple: an almond, surrounded by coconut, surrounded by chocolate. Simple, brilliant, and incredibly delicious. Why did it take us so long to think of this?	http://traderjoes.com/images/fearless-flyer/uploads/article-1897/choc-coconut-almonds.png	http://www.amazon.com/Trader-Joes-Chocolate-Coconut-Almonds/dp/B00O4K6ZWY	2014-10-29 19:50:29.646-07	2014-10-29 19:50:29.646-07

18	Toscano Cheese with Cinnamon	Toscano with Cinnamon has the nutty flavor of aged Parmesan and the creamy texture of farmstead Cheddar. Each young wheel of cheese is coated in cinnamon—as the cheese ages, the cinnamon gently infuses the cheese.	http://traderjoes.com/images/fearless-flyer/uploads/article-1837/toscano-cheese.png		2014-10-29 19:54:39.897-07	2014-10-29 19:54:39.897-07

23	Roasted Mashed Sweet Potatoes	Covington sweet potatoes grown in the American south, roasted to caramelize their natural sugars, and mashed until they're nearly - but not quite—smooth.	http://traderjoes.com/images/fearless-flyer/uploads/article-1848/roasted-mashed-sweet-potatoes.png		2014-10-29 20:01:11.839-07	2014-10-29 20:01:11.839-07
